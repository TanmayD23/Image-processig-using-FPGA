# Image-processig-using-FPGA
This is an ongoing project in which we are implementing an underwater colour correction algorithm on FPGA.
Underwater images require colour correction beacuse longer wavelengths of light can travel only a small distance below the water surface.
Due ti this the colour of the object we see shifts towards blue.
So we use Discrete wavelet transform to enhance the colour of the image, so that we can get the true colours of the image.
